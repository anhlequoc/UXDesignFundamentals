## Using the Elements - Skeleton

### Defining Skeleton: function given form

The skeleton plane focuses on concrete issues of presentation: 
- What form will the product take? 
- How will users move around and do things? 
- How will content be presented and manipulated? 

The skeleton plane is created through interface design, which provides users with the ability to do things. 
It's also comprised of navigation design, which provides 
users with the ability to go places. 

Our work on this plan has to enable several key principles of positive UX:
- Rapidly establish value in the user's mind 
- Lead user toward continuing the experience 
- Introduce specific content at the most relevant, most appropriate points in the experience 
- Add immediate value with each click/tap 
- Add positively to the overall experience over time with each interaction

Habit and reflex account for much of our daily interactions.
- Our ability to do anything depends on the **accumulation of reflexes**, most of which are pretty small. 
- Convention is what allows us to use those reflexes. 
- Conventions often match our expectations of what something is supposed to do or be like. 

### Interface Design: The Balancing Act
Success in user interface (UI) design comes from **balance** between **visual form** & **technical function**. That means: 
- You have to give people the things they want or need. 
- You have to give it to them when and where they want it. 
- You have to deliver it in a visual format that ensures they can (and want to) access all of it. 

Every element counts:
Although the functionality of an app or site is important, the form used to deliver that functionality is equally important: 
- Organization of content 
- Layout of the screen 
- Use of audio and video 
- How people use their hands and fingers to move through data 
 
No matter how technically superior the code is or how deep its functionality, the bottom line is... 
> An app or site whose interface is difficult to use WON'T BE USED

A few ground rules:
- To most people, the Ul is the system. 
- A well designed Ul allows people to start using it immediately with little or no help. 
- Ul design has to be audience-appropriate: just because you understand it doesn't mean 
- someone else will. 
- Inappropriate UI design is the number one killer of great product ideas. 
- It's better to perfectly meet the needs of the critical few than to poorly meet the needs of many. 

Core Priciples of Good UI design:
1. Predictability: mean we can actually predict the outcome of an action

2. Consistency:
Usability improves when similar **parts** are expressed in **similar ways**
This **functional consistency** leverages existing knowledge:
- Familiar meaning & action
- Navigational reference points 
- Simplified usability 
- Increased intuitive learning 

-> Single try learning: use it one, remember forever

4. Intuitiveness: means single-trial learning

5. Context + Hierarchy:

6. Hick's law: Every addtional choice increases the time requried to make a decision
> the more choice you give people, the easier it is to **choose nothing.**

In the era of infinite choice, people need a better filters

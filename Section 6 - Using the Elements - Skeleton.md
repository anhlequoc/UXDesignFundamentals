## Using the Elements - Skeleton

### Defining Skeleton: function given form

The skeleton plane focuses on concrete issues of presentation: 
- What form will the product take? 
- How will users move around and do things? 
- How will content be presented and manipulated? 

The skeleton plane is created through interface design, which provides users with the ability to do things. 
It's also comprised of navigation design, which provides 
users with the ability to go places. 

Our work on this plan has to enable several key principles of positive UX:
- Rapidly establish value in the user's mind 
- Lead user toward continuing the experience 
- Introduce specific content at the most relevant, most appropriate points in the experience 
- Add immediate value with each click/tap 
- Add positively to the overall experience over time with each interaction 

Feature vs Usability:

Habit and reflex account for much of our daily interactions.
- Our ability to do anything depends on the **accumulation of reflexes**, most of which are pretty small. 
- Convention is what allows us to use those reflexes. 
- Conventions often match our expectations of what something is supposed to do or be like. 

### Interface Design: The Balancing Act
Success in user interface (UI) design comes from **balance** between **visual form** & **technical function**. That means: 
- You have to give people the things they want or need. 
- You have to give it to them when and where they want it. 
- You have to deliver it in a visual format that ensures they can (and want to) access all of it. 

Every element counts:
Although the functionality of an app or site is important, the form used to deliver that functionality is equally important: 
- Organization of content 
- Layout of the screen 
- Use of audio and video 
- How people use their hands and fingers to move through data 
 
No matter how technically superior the code is or how deep its functionality, the bottom line is... 
> An app or site whose interface is difficult to use WON'T BE USED

A few ground rules:
- To most people, the Ul is the system. 
- A well designed Ul allows people to start using it immediately with little or no help. 
- Ul design has to be audience-appropriate: just because you understand it doesn't mean 
- someone else will. 
- Inappropriate UI design is the number one killer of great product ideas. 
- It's better to perfectly meet the needs of the critical few than to poorly meet the needs of many. 

Core Priciples of Good UI design:
1. Predictability: mean we can actually predict the outcome of an action
![Core Principles - Predictability](https://i.imgur.com/V2r5O3U.png)

2. Consistency:
Usability improves when similar **parts** are expressed in **similar ways**
This **functional consistency** leverages existing knowledge:
- Familiar meaning & action
- Navigational reference points 
- Simplified usability 
- Increased intuitive learning 

-> Single try learning: use it one, remember forever

3. Progressive Disclosure

4. Intuitiveness: means single-trial learning

5. Context + Hierarchy:

6. Hick's law: Every addtional choice increases the time requried to make a decision
> the more choice you give people, the easier it is to **choose nothing.**
(có nhiều lý do logic và tâm lý cho việc này)

In the era of infinite choice, people need a better filters

### Navigation Design: from sitemap to screen
The **navigation system** — along with **content and context** — should help a user understand where they are. 
Navigation design typically starts with a **site map**.

![Navigation System](https://i.imgur.com/j6pe0lS.png)

>Good navigation design passes what author Steve Krug calls "the trunk test" (don't make me think)
See explanation in this screenshot: 
![Navigation System - The Trunk Test](https://i.imgur.com/fR8VSga.png)

How do you find what you want?
- Browsing via a navigation system 
- Searching via keywords/phrases 
- Using filters to narrow large lists and sets of information 
- Using pagination controls to provide: 
    + Location information
    + Sense of depth/breadth
    + Ability to navigate large

#### Some points need to check to make sure we're designing navigation that works

No scavenger hunts!

Be consistent
Use the same **interactions**, **behaviors** and **visual styles** throughout the entire site, app or system.

Elements of navigation should never:
- Appear and disappear
- Rearrange their order
- Move to a different location

Even changing the organization of the page underneath the nav can disrupt someone's understanding of how things work.

### Convention and Metaphor
> Use conventions and metaphors to **set and keep** standard

- The _appearance_ and _location_ of common navigation systems have evolved over time to become conventions. 
- Those conventions tell us what to look for and where to look when we need them. 
- Putting them in a standard place allows us to locate them quickly. 
- Standardizing their appearance makes it easy to pick them out among everything else. 
- How frustrating is it when one of these conventions is broken?

Habit and Reflex (redux)
**Convention** allows us to apply accumulated habits and reflexes in different circumstances.
Conventions often become standards for devices that have nothing to do with the one that started the idea.
Your interface design should be consistent with **others** your users are already familiar with.
It should also be consistent with **itself**.

Intuitive and Obvious

### Information Design
Infomration Design is invisible, unless it's bad, it will be revealed, there will be many obvious consequences:
- A form that's difficult to complete, resulting in errors.
- Poor instructions that cause frustration or even danger.
- Poor educational materials that don't promote learning.
- Poorly represented scientific data that's misinterpreted.
- Manufacturing Uls that don't warn of potential danger.
- Websites that are difficult to navigate and unpleasant to look at.

Think about Information Design like **the glue that holds all the elements together**
- How do we present information so people understand it more easily? 
- Information design is visual, but that doesn't mean we're focused on the finished look & feel. 
- Our focus is on the effectiveness of the form — does it communicate clearly? 
- Think of it as "sense-making." 
- Good information design supports the goals of both user and creator. 

Context is everything:
Information elements should be **grouped** and **arranged** in ways that:
- Reflect how users think
- Match what they expect
- Support their tasks and goals
Quick Example:
![Confusing vs Contextual](https://i.imgur.com/cglQr8e.png)

#### Organization Methods:
1. use alphabetical when:
Alphabetical Order
![Alphabetical Order](https://i.imgur.com/7qwg2vE.png)

2. use categorical when:
Categorical
![Categorical Order](https://i.imgur.com/QRENbWe.png)

3. use a continuum when:

#### Appropriate Form

Basecamp is more straighforward than MS Project
![Basecamp vs MS Project](https://i.imgur.com/egybhV6.png)

MS Project có rất nhiều tính năng mà Basecamp không có nhưng Basecamp chỉ tập trung vào 1 tính năng duy nhất, cốt lỗi là tăng communication between members of the team in common place
> Part of appropriate form is making sure that what you're putting out there directly answers the needs of the people using it meet their core needs and forget about everything. Always remember that the simplest solution is usually the right solution

### Wireframes
> A wireframe is a skeleton of a screen; it shows the priority and organization of things on the screen. It details how users will get to other parts of the site/app. 

Wireframes reflect the designer's ideas about: 
    - Placement of elements on the screen 
    - Labeling of those elements 
    - Navigation scheme 
    - Functionality, behavior and feedback 

Wireframes vary in their **level of detail**
![Sample Wireframes](https://i.imgur.com/W59AIcm.png)

don't care about font, color, typography, image, visual style of any kind... don't care about look and feel, just care about how much information is displayed, the layout of information...

![Sample Wireframes](https://i.imgur.com/Dx51iF4.png)

Wireframe in very details:
![Wireframe in very details](https://i.imgur.com/PQwNo97.png)

Why bother with wireframes: because design has to consider: 
    - How each screen fits in with the site/app/system as a whole 
    - What content, links and interactions are needed to meet both user needs and business goals 
    - How all of these elements relate to each other 

Wireframe with descriptions:
![wireframes with description](https://i.imgur.com/ZwMRlwp.png)

What wireframe tell us:
    - what to look for 
    - What content will be included 
    - How that content is organized 
    - Which content is most important 
    - A given screen's location in the system 
    - Where users can go and what they can do 
    - How users will move around the system 

#### THE WIREFRAME PROCESS:
1) Revisit Needs and Goals
    - Why is this valuable to my intended user? 
    - What can it do to make their life better? 
    - How can I make it easier for them to act? 
    - What actions are most valuable on each screen? 
    - Across the entire system? 
    - How can I measure the impact of this action? 

2) Establish Cores and Paths
    - Cores are the primary pieces of content and functionality you want users to see and interact with. 
    - Users take paths to enter and leave each screen in the system. 
    - The goal is to prioritize content on the screen, and delineate clear paths for people to get to and from each screen. 

FORM for BA/UX designer:
![BA UX form](https://i.imgur.com/sKkBTOo.png)

Top: list core user needs and core business goals
Center: two main categories
    - Core content & Functionality: what content is there and what can people do with it...
    - Supporting information, navigation & outgoing paths (what has to be represented on screen)
Left: incoming paths, it's all the places you can come from to get to this page
Right: outgoing paths: how many exit paths are there
Bottom:
    - Trigger words: which are essentially suggestions to take action there, key labels, key concepts that need to be expressed
    - Core Elements: all the core things that have to be included on this page that's just to make sure that we don't miss anything
    - Calls to action: the primary things we're asking the user to do once they're here
     
3) Start Sketching:
You'll be tempted to skip this phase. DON'T. 
    - **Quickly** generate thumbnail sketches. 
    - Your goal is to get down a **high volume** of **decent ideas** of what the screen(s) should look like. 
    - **Don't** think about usability or information hierarchy — just get as many different ideas out of your head as possible.
Sample sketch:
![Sample Sketch](https://i.imgur.com/lGtdsKv.png)

4) Rapid Prototying:
    - Find a wireframing tool that works for you: Visio, OmniGraffle, Balsamiq, Axure, UXPin, etc. 
    - DON'T use PowerPoint, Illustrator, InDesign, etc. 
    - Try not to use "lorem ipsum" text — content is just as important to the design as button placement and navigational elements. 
    - Remember that what you're creating is not final design (or anything close to it). 

5) Question to ask:
    - Is anything important **missing**? 
    - Is the **most important** content noticed first? 
    - Is there anything that **shouldn't** be here? 
    - Which content is **related** — and how? 
    - Can you get to **all of the major areas** from here? should you be able to? 
    - Do all of the **labels** make sense? 
    - Do you know what all of the **elements** are? 
    - Is the **purpose** of each element clear? 
    - Does the **flow** of **tasks** or **information** match the user's need or expectation? 
    - Are **additional features** or functions needed? 

### THINGS TO REMEMBER
- The skeleton plane is created through **interface design**, which provides users with the ability to do things, and **navigation design**, which provides users with the ability to go places. 
- Good interface design uses **progressive disclosure** to maximize signal and minimize noise. 
- A product with a poorly designed user interface **won't be used** — no matter how technically superior the code is or how deep its functionality may be. 
- Good **navigation design** reveals the depth of site content, provides **a sense of place** and allows users to **predict** the outcome of an interaction. 
- Good **information design** is the **glue** that holds things together — supporting the goals of both user and creator. 
- The only time you should deviate from a well- established convention is when there is a clear, obvious **benefit** to doing so.

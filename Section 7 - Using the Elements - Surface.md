## USING THE ELEMENTS - SUFACE

### Defning Surface: Visible Language
Visible language indicates **context** and conveys **information**: 
    - **Layout**: formats, proportions, grids and organization 
    - **Typography**: font selection and styling 
    - **Color**: influencing perception and emotion 
    - **Imagery**: signs, icons and symbols 
    - **Sequencing**: overall approach to visual storytelling
    - **Visual Identity**: how the organization or the produt line expresses itself in visible language

Economizing: (minimizing)

Communicating:
- Visual design has to **balance legibility, readability, typography, symbolism, multiple views**, and **color** or **texture** in order to communicate successfully. 

- pattern recognition:

- visual design is NOT decoration:
    + It should never be based on personal preference. 
    + It should never be based on what "looks cool." 
    + Ask how your design choices work, not how they look: 
    + Do they support established objectives? 
    + Do they clarify the options available? 
    + Do they provide context and guidance? 
    + Do they establish clear information/action priority? 

### Visual Design Principles
There are **4 basic principles** used to organize visual information: 
    - **Alignment** 
    - **proximity** 
    - **Repetition** 
    - **Contrast** 
These principles are **interconnected** - you will never only apply one principle

1) Alignment

2) Proximity

3) Repetition:

one way to set repetition is setting up design patterns:

> Make visual consistency

4) Contrast:

### Contrast and Uniformity
Contrast draws and focuses attention 
Lack of contrast causes the eye to bounce around without settling on anything. 

Contrast performs three essential functions: 
- Draws the user's attention to the essential components of the interface 
- Helps the user understand relationships between navigational elements and content 
- Communicates hierarchy and importance within and across multiple sets of information 

We pay attention to differences:

Uniformity:

### Consistency
**consistency is what makes a system**
Consistency in visual design allows users to build an accurate mental model of the way the site, app or system works. 
- Are buttons and controls placed consistently? 
- Is language consistent in labels and messages? 
- Are font styles, images, graphic elements and color schemes applied consistently across each screen? 
- Do buttons or controls respond to user actions consistently in terms of visual display, appropriate context and functionality? 

External Inconsistency:

### Color and Typography

What color does:
![what color does](https://i.imgur.com/RXGkBrA.png)

Working with color
- highlight, not determine
![highlight](https://i.imgur.com/kg4iRuH.png)

- evaluate proper color use
    - Are colors used sparingly? 
    - Do my colors reinforce or interfere 
    - with hierarchy and content? 
    - Is the color scheme used consistently? 
    - Is color use functional, or just decorative? 
    - Does functionality depend on color? 
    - Would this be just as functional 
    - for someone who's color blind? 

Working with typography
- serif or sans? (sans is better than serif)
![serif or sans](https://i.imgur.com/7px5kTM.png)

- use it purposefully

- consistent styling

### Things to remember
- The surface plane can be thought of as visible (and visual) language. 
This visible language is created by techniques used to indicate context and convey information: layout, typography, color, imagery, sequencing and visual identity.
- Effective visual design serves to organize, economize and communicate. 
- There are four basic principles used to organize visual information: alignment, proximity, repetition and contrast. 
- Good visual design leads the eye through the screen in a smooth flow, giving the user a guided tour of what's available.
- Consistency in visual design allows users to build an accurate mental model of the way the site, app or system works. 
- The right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen and influence emotional esponse. 
- The right colors maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue. 
- If you're going to use more than one typeface, each should be visually distinct from the other. 
- Use these different styles only to indicate differences in the information you're presenting.

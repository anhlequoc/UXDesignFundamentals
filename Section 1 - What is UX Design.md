# Introduction: an UXD

### What UXD isnt'
It is not:
    - Interface design: Inteface Ã­ a component of UX, but there's much more. UX includes person react, business goal...
    - UX is not just practiced by designer, by project manager, developer, software architecturer
    - UXD is not a step in a process, in fact it's the process

```
    "it's about how we live. it's about everything we do. it surrounds us"
```
### What UXD is
UX simply refers to the way a product behaves and is used in the real world. A positive UX is one in which the goals of both the user and the organization that created the product are met

Usability is one attribute of a successfuly UX, but usability alone does not make an experience positive for the user

```
business goals + user/customer goals + user interface + back-end process = UXD
```

UXD's attributes: useful, desirable, accessible, credible, findable, usable
 
 ### Why should we care about UXD
When you see an object, we make a series of **instanct assumptions** about it. What it does, how well and what the cost of use is, either in time or money?

## Using the elements - strategy

### The **research** process
Strategic UX Research:

    Step 1: Stakeholder Interviews: client side: director of Marketing, project manager...
    Step 2: Competitor Review: looking for competing product, company, ...know what they're doing? well or not well?
    Step 3: User Interview and/or research: how they would like to complete a task of your product?
    Step 4: Existing Product Audit
    -> Analyze and Review

### Business Goals: Stakeholder Questions
Identify Business Goal:

    - What should the product accomplish for the business?
    - Who are your customers or users?
    - How does this project fit with your business strategy?
    - How do you expect to differentiate this product?
    - What technologo decisions have already been made?
    - Why do customer use a product like this one?
    - If they use a competitor's product instead, what's the reason?
    - What things do customers complain about most often?

### User Needs: Questions for B2B Users 
Questions:

    - Tell me about your **background** and **role**
    - What makes a good workday for you?
    - How does function or process **work** here?
    - what are the different **groups** and **roles** involved in function or process? how do they work together?
    - How does this compare to your previous companies?
    - What are the biggest problems and inefficiencies?
    - Can you tell me about the other **system** that work with this one?

### User Needs: Questions for B2C users
Questions:

    - Tell me what makes a good (shopping, watching, ...) **experience**?
    - What things would you usually do **first** here? Why?
    - What would you **put off** as long as you can here? Why? (chẳng hạn phải nhập lại username khi checkout, phải nhập lại address khi đã nhập ở lần trước rồi... )
    - How **often** do you use this product?
    - What do you **use it for** most often?
    - Could you **show me** how you do that?
    - What things do you use **before, during or after** this product?
    - How would you **compare** this product to others you've used? (asking for review or response, can ask: top 3 things of this site...?)

### Three Crucial Questions (ask yourself)
**1) What's worth doing?**
Estimate the importance and feasibility/viability of features, divide them into 3 levels:

    - Ignore this stuff completely (lowest priority)
    - Strongly consider accomodating this stuff
    - Include this stuff or _die_ (highest priority)

**2) What are we creating?**
For example:

    - Client thinks it's a square
    - PM thinks it's a triangle
    - Dev thinks it's a asterisk
-> absolutely know what you 're creating

**3) What value does it provide?**

    - Who is the target audience? (người dùng là ai)
    - What experiences are compelling to them? (cái gì hấp dẫn họ?)
    - How is the offering different from both competitors and substitutes?

### "First Use" Experience Questions (what is the user's expectation at first time of use?)
Some questions:

    - What is this?
    - Is this what I expected to see?
    - Does it look credible and trustworthy?
    - Does it offer what I want?
    - Does it look valuable enough to stick around?
    - What actions can I take now?
    - What actions can I take now?
    - How do I learn more?
    - How do I contact someone?

### Strategy Takeaways: things to remember

> You must have a **very** clear roadmap to creating value for both _the user and the business_
> Successful User Experience Design is born from clear **strategy** that determines what the customer experience should be
> That overall experience must be driven by **business goals** and **user/customer** needs
> Know your users - and remember **they are not you** (you're designing, developing, organizing information for them, not for you)

### Exercises:

- List multiple business opportunities for a real or made-up product
- Rate each opportunity on a scale of 1-5 in two categories:
    - IMPORTANT: How **crucial** is it that the business solves this problem?
    - FEASIBILITY: How **realistic** is it that we can design and build a solution?

Example: Online Bookseller (website)
1. Lập bảng đánh giá:

column1 | column2 | column3
------- | ------- | -------
Problem/Opportunity | Importance | Feasibility
Increase unique visitors | 4 | 2 (tốn phí marketing...)
Increase purchases per visit | 5 | 4
Increase number of titles | 1 | 3
Increase number of authors | 3 | 3

2. How **important** is it that you solve each problem or take advantage of each opportunity? How **realistic** is it that you can accomplish each?
-> sử dụng công thức: tính middle score của mỗi column **middle score x number of opportunities = points available**
    - middle score is 3
    - number of opportunities is 4
    -> points available is 12 (total effort is 12)
        Total points of importance: 13 -> does not work
        Total points of feasibility: 12

3. So sánh với đồ thị (trục tung là importance, trục hoành là feasibility):
    - Include or die: là Increase purchases per visit
    - Strongly consider accomodating: Increase unique visitors & Increase number of authors
    - Ignore: Increase number of titles

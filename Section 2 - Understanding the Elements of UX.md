> There are 5 elements or "planes" of UX: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, surface. From Strategy to Surface is from Abstract to Concrete (trừu tượng -> cụ thể)

### 1st: STRATEGY
The site, the system or app's reason for being
    - why people is willing to use it? why they need it?

    > Task + Information: User Needs, Business Objectives

Questions
    - What do they want and expect from us?
    - How does that fit in with their **other goals**?

Business Objectives define success, and typically mean making money, saving money for both
Both have to be measurable - how will we know if we've succeeded? (such as user tăng lên ntn? traffic tăng lên ko? sau bao lâu?)

### 2nd: SCOPE
Features and Functions contained within the site, system or app
    > Task: Functional Specification
    > Information: Content Requirements (what content, what data need to interact, manipulate with)

STRATEGY becomes scope when user needs and business objectives are translated into **requirements** for content & functionality
    - Functional Specification describe the feature set of the product - what are we creating?
    - Content Requirements detail what's required to provide value to users - text, data, images, audio, video, etc...

### 3rd: STRUCTURE
The number of places you can go, organized contextually

    > Task: Interaction Design (when clicking on a link: what do I get?...)
    > Information: information architecture - the arrangement of content, information throughout the entire site and system, how much is it? how is it organized, how deep is it?

Scope is given structure when we define how the system responds to the user's actions
**Interaction Design** creates a structured experience of patterns and sequences that present appropriate options to users
    - if user submit a form, what happens?
    - if user pull down a menu, what happens? how system responds?

**Information architecture** defines the volumn of content, along with how it's organized, arranged and priotirized

### 4th: SKELETON (wireframe)
The optimized organization and arrangement of visual elements
    - such as menu options, navigation, content, control, button element..
-> firgure how all things work together, not only in one screen, but also in entire system/site/app

    > Task + Information:
        - Interface Design: button, menu, control
        - Navigation Design
        - Information Design

Interface Design determines how to best *arrange* and *present* visual elements for the user to interact with
Navigation Design's onscreen elements allow users to move through tasks and information *intuitively*


### 5th: SURFACE
It's UI screens (what user sees): images, text, things users can interact with

    > Task + Information: Visual design - both of all planes: color will be used? ...

Visual Design is the last UI (mock-up, not wireframe) done by designer, has color, layout, theme.... use colors, images, typography and effects, each specifically chosen to:
    - support and reinforce the **meaning** of content
    - guide the user through data, tasks, or information
    - reduce **coginitive load**, enable **recognition** and increase **intuitive learning**
    - Be culturally/socially **appropriate**


> 5 planes for answering questions: what we're doing? why we're doing? who we're doing for?

### Planes Are Interdependent
> Requiring work involved with each plane to **finish** before work on the next can start is problematic - and usually results in a frustrating user experience
> Technology has to be appropriate. The right platform is critical in delivering greate experiences. Techonology can't be seen as an add-on or a nice to have - it needs to be inherent in how we design
> Touchscreen, for example, have changed the way we navigate digital information
